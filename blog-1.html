  <h3>Pandas</h3>

<p>Data Science.</p>
<p>Data.</p>
<p>It's right there in the name.</p>
<p>Using the Python programming language and it's many libraries, Data Scientists can complete a veriety of different tasks. One of the main tasks of a Data Scientist is to work with 'data' and figure out how to use it to their advantage to solve vast amounts of problems that arise every single day.</p>
<p>One of the most important libraries of the Python programming language is 'Pandas' and we will be exploring some of the capabilities of this library and how it can be used to:</p>
<p>1) Create DataFrames/Upload data</p>
<p>2) Filter and extract data</p>
<p>3) Exploring and Analyzing data</p>
<p>4) Structuring desired data for plots</p>
<p>If you're someone like me who needs to see things in action to get a better understanding of how they work then do not worry we are about to get started now!</p>
<p><img alt="test" src="images\panda.png"></p>
<p>The first thing we need to do is to import the Pandas library into our notebook to get started:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pandas</span> <span class="kn">as</span> <span class="nn">pd</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Pandas is always loaded into the notebook as pd (don't ask why it just is!)</p>
<p><em>It is good practice to alway load whichever libraries you will be using in your work at the very beginning of your notebook</em></p>
<p>The beauty of using Pandas is that it allows you to analyze and explore data in many different ways and many different sizes.</p>
<p>You can load prebuilt datasets using:</p>
<p>data_name = pd.read_csv('file_name.csv') </p>
<p><em>(This function allows you to upload csv files which are excel based into your notebook. This is extremely helpful when you need to analyze large data sets which are already created using excel files)</em></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Lets say you want to analyze a small data sample. You can easily whip up your own data set using Pandas pd.DataFrame function. 
Lets go ahead and give you an example:</p>
<p><em>I am going to quickly whip up a dataframe of the Toronto Raptors 2019 championship roster and assign columns to hold information</em></p>

<p>Here I have created my very own DataFrame by inputting information into a dictionary and using the pd.DataFrame function to return me an organized table using the columns that I specified to help me now better explore and analyze the data.</p>
<p>From my own personal experience, I know that python code can be a little intimidating at first glance and can make things seems a little confusing so lets break down my process here step by step:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Call upon the pd.DataFrame() function to specify what the code will be doing
<em>(we will be building our data within the ()</em>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using {} specifies that we will be creating a dictionary</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now to populate the dictionary with the information:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>'name', 'age', 'nationality', and 'position' are the names of the columns I want to created for my data
<em>(if you look closely you wil notice that the column names are inside the {} but are on the outside of the [] )</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we will use [] to populate a list of information inside each column name we want created 
<em>(eg. for the name column we will populate a list[] of Raptor player names, for the age column a list[] of ages, and so on...)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once we are finished populating the information we desire we simply wrap the code up and voila...</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>WE GOT OURSELVES A DATASET!</p>
<p>The return output will be the information we inputted in the form of a table displayed above</p>
<p>Since we have created this dataset exactly how we wanted we know that the information in here is legit. But, that is not always the case especially when you need to explore big datasets. Information can be corrupted, missing, all kinds of stuff and it is up to us to figure it out.</p>
<p>Now we are going to explore some functions that will help us view our data more closely and help us better understand it. 
DataFrames are extremely powerful and useful objects: 'containers' that hold a lot of information. There are many functions built within Pandas that will allow us explore and manipulate this data to our liking but today we are going to just focus on just some of the basics.</p>
<p>We are going to be taking a look at:</p>
<p>.head()
.dtypes
.info()</p>
<p>Lets bring back our DataFrame and get started.</p>
