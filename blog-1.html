<p>Data Science.</p>
<p>Data.</p>
<p>It's right there in the name.</p>
<p>Using the Python programming language and it's many libraries, Data Scientists can complete a veriety of different tasks. One of the main tasks of a Data Scientist is to work with 'data' and figure out how to use it to their advantage to solve vast amounts of problems that arise every single day.</p>
<p>One of the most important libraries of the Python programming language is 'Pandas' and we will be exploring some of the capabilities of this library and how it can be used to:</p>
<p>1) Create DataFrames/Upload data</p>
<p>2) Filter and extract data</p>
<p>3) Exploring and Analyzing data</p>
<p>4) Structuring desired data for plots</p>
<p>If you're someone like me who needs to see things in action to get a better understanding of how they work then do not worry we are about to get started now.</p>
