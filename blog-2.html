  <h3>LabelBinarizer vs get_dummies</h3>
  <label>2019-07-01</label>
  <p>LabelBinarizer and get_dummies are two features of Scikit-Learn/Pandas that are extremely crucial when it comes to transforming data for the purpose of train-test split (creating models and testing them). Like everything, they both come with their own set of pros and cons in terms of when it is appropriate to use them or when potentially using them can limit what you can do in terms of effectively creating models and its efficiency.</p>
<p>In this post we are going to explore how both of them work with data and by the end of this post we will be able to clearly see which one of these features is better for us to use based on it's capabitilies.</p>
<p>To get started we will need to import some Python libraries and then create a DataFrame to run these features on.</p>
